ei2-image
============

## What is this and what is it good for?

ei2-image is a suite of web-components that make it slightly (only very
slightly) easier to load images from CCP's awesome EVE Online image server.
Instead of writing src URLs in `<img>` tags (such as
`https://image.eveonline.com/Character/94306456_64.jpg`) it allows you to write
slightly more readable things like this:

     <ei2-char-image eId="94306456_64"></ei2-char-image>

What is even more cool is that it uses
[Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org) and its similarly awesome
`<core-image>` element so you get all those extra features (preloading 
and fading images, smart sizing, etc) as well.
